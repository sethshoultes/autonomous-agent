# Project Manifest: Autonomous Agent System

## Project Overview
Privacy-focused autonomous agent system for email management, research automation, and development tasks using local AI processing with Ollama integration.

## Architecture
- **Orchestration**: Prefect-based workflow management
- **Agent Framework**: Modular agents with single responsibilities
- **Local AI**: Ollama integration for privacy-focused processing
- **Design principles**: KISS, DRY, YAGNI, SOLID, TDD methodology
- **Communication**: Redis-based message queue between agents

## Current Status
- Last updated: 2025-07-08 (Phase 1 Foundation Complete)
- Current milestone: Phase 2 - Core Agents Implementation
- Current stage: 100% Phase 1 complete, Ready for Phase 2

## Components
- **Agent Manager**: âœ… COMPLETED - Central coordination and communication hub with registry
- **Configuration System**: âœ… COMPLETED - Multi-format config loading with validation
- **Testing Framework**: âœ… COMPLETED - TDD infrastructure with 90%+ coverage enforcement
- **Communication Protocol**: âœ… COMPLETED - Message broker with routing and validation
- **Logging Framework**: âœ… COMPLETED - Structured logging with multiple handlers
- **Base Agent Classes**: âœ… COMPLETED - Abstract base classes following SOLID principles
- **Gmail Agent**: ðŸ”„ NEXT - Email processing, classification, and automation
- **Research Agent**: ðŸ”„ NEXT - Web scraping and content aggregation
- **Code Agent**: ðŸ”„ NEXT - GitHub integration and automated code reviews
- **Ollama Integration**: ðŸ”„ NEXT - Local AI model management and processing

## Next Steps
- Implement Gmail Agent with email processing and automation
- Build Research Agent for web scraping and content aggregation
- Create Code Agent for GitHub integration and reviews
- Set up Docker environment for containerization
- Configure Prefect server for workflow orchestration
- Establish Ollama integration for local AI processing
